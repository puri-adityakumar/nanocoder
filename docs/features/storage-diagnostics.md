# Storage diagnostics

Run `nanocoder storage` in a terminal to inspect Nanocoder-wide sessions and
artifacts alongside the current project's timeline and checkpoints. This opens
a dedicated, read-only dashboard without starting a chat session, loading a
model, or asking you to trust the directory. The store list shows sizes and
finding counts; the selected store shows its **global** or **project** scope,
root path, limits, entries, and findings. On narrow terminals the panes stack.
Use Up/Down to select a store, Enter to explore its entries, then Enter again
for an item or finding's details and path. Esc goes back (or exits from the
store list); `q` or Ctrl+C exits at any time. A "potential orphan" warning does
not prove a session is inactive. Note that timeline and checkpoint directories
are intentionally not cross-referenced against saved sessions because an unsaved 
or live session can still legally own them, and checkpoints do not track session IDs.

For scripts or terminals without an interactive TTY, use:

```sh
nanocoder storage --format json | jq .sections
```

This prints one JSON document to stdout and exits. Errors go to stderr with a
nonzero exit status. Neither mode deletes, cleans, or repairs data. To see the
available syntax, run `nanocoder storage --help`.
