# Getting Started

Welcome to Nanocoder! This section covers everything you need to install, configure, and start using Nanocoder.

## Quick Start

1. **Install** Nanocoder via npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @nanocollective/nanocoder
   ```

2. **Run** in any project directory:

   ```bash
   nanocoder
   ```

3. **Configure** a provider when prompted, or run `/settings providers` for the interactive wizard.

## CLI Options

Nanocoder supports standard CLI arguments for quick information and help:

```bash
# Show version information
nanocoder --version
nanocoder -v

# Show help and available options
nanocoder --help
nanocoder -h
```

**CLI Options Reference:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--version` | `-v` | Display the installed version number |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show usage information and available options |
| `--vscode` | | Run in VS Code mode (for extension) |
| `--vscode-port` | | Ask for a specific VS Code server port. By default it binds an ephemeral port and publishes it to a discovery file the extension reads, so this is only needed when you want a known port (e.g. for port forwarding). If the requested port is busy, the next 10 ports are tried in turn and the one actually bound is written to the discovery file and the log |
| `--acp` | | Run as an [ACP server](../features/acp.md) for editor integration (Zed, etc.) |
| `--provider` | | Specify AI provider by its configured name (must be configured in agents.config.json). Quote names with spaces, e.g. `--provider "GitHub Copilot"` |
| `--model` | | Specify AI model (must be available for the provider) |
| `--plain` | | Use the lightweight, Ink-free runtime for non-interactive runs. Requires `run`; auto-enables in CI and non-TTY environments |
| `--no-plain` | | Force the Ink runtime even in CI and non-TTY environments |
| `--json` | | Emit a single structured JSON object to `stdout` on completion instead of streamed text. Supported by `run` and `review`, even in a terminal: `run` uses the plain runtime and `review` runs headless. Incompatible with `--acp` and `--vscode`; `run --json` is also incompatible with `--no-plain` |
| `--output-format` | | Set the `stdout` format, `text` or `json`. Synonym for `--json` |
| `--context-max` | | Set maximum context length in tokens (supports k/K suffix, e.g. `128k`) |
| `--mode` | | Start in a specific [development mode](../features/development-modes.md) - `normal`, `auto-accept`, `yolo`, `plan`, or `architect`. Defaults to `auto-accept` for `run` mode; interactive sessions use `defaultMode` from `agents.config.json` if set, otherwise `normal`. |
| `--trust-directory` | | Skip the first-run directory trust prompt for this run only. Valid with `run`, `review`, and `nanocoder daemon start`; ignored (with a warning) in interactive mode. The trust is ephemeral - `trustedDirectories` in your preferences file is not modified. |
| `--alt-screen` | | Start in fullscreen mode: a fixed-height layout on the alternate screen buffer with in-app scrolling (enabled by default). |
| `--no-alt-screen` | | Disable fullscreen mode and force inline mode (main screen, chat history in the terminal's native scrollback). |
| `--mouse` | | In fullscreen mode, the mouse wheel scrolls the chat viewport; select text with Shift+drag (Option+drag in iTerm2). Enabled by default. |
| `--no-mouse` | | Disable mouse reporting in fullscreen mode: native text selection works directly, but the wheel no longer scrolls chat history. |
| `--prompt-file <path>` | | Read the `run` prompt from a file instead of the command line. Takes precedence over a positional prompt. Use it for large prompts: Linux caps a single argument at 128 KiB, and anything bigger fails to launch with `E2BIG`. Only valid with `run`. |
| `--continue` | `-c` | Resume the most recent [saved session](../features/session-management.md) for the current directory; starts a fresh session if none exists. Interactive only — errors with `run`. Mutually exclusive with `--resume`. |
| `--resume [id]` | `-r` | Resume a [saved session](../features/session-management.md) by session ID, 1-based list index, or `last`. With no ID, opens the session picker at startup. Errors if the session is not found. Interactive only — errors with `run`. |
| `init [--preset <type>] [-f\|--force] [--lean]` | | Initialize the current project. Bundled presets: `react`, `nextjs`, and `rust`. `--force` regenerates an existing `AGENTS.md`; `--lean` skips `CLAUDE.md` when merging existing project guidance |
| `run` | | Run in non-interactive mode |
| `review` | | Grounded review of a branch or PR: findings must cite changed code and pass an independent verifier. See [code review](../features/review.md) |
| `daemon <start\|stop\|status\|logs\|install\|uninstall>` | | Manage the per-project [skill daemon](../features/skills.md#the-daemon). `start` refuses an untrusted directory unless `--trust-directory` is passed |
| `skills add <target>` | | Install a skill bundle from an index name, `owner/repo`, a git URL or a local path. Flags: `--ref`, `--subdir`, `--global`, `--force`, `--yes`, `--index` |
| `config <list\|show [key]\|diff>` | | Inspect the resolved configuration and where each value came from. Add `--json` for machine output |
| `completion <bash\|zsh\|fish>` | | Print a [shell completion](../features/shell-completions.md) script |
| `copilot login [provider-name]` | | Log in to GitHub Copilot with the device-code flow. Credentials are saved for the named provider (default `GitHub Copilot`) and must match the provider's `name` in your config |
| `codex login [provider-name]` | | Log in to ChatGPT/Codex with the device-code flow. Credentials are saved for the named provider and must match the provider's `name` in your config |

**Provider/Model Flags:**

The `--provider` and `--model` flags allow you to specify the AI provider and model directly from the CLI, bypassing the need to use slash commands or edit configuration files. Providers must be pre-configured in your `agents.config.json` file.

If an invalid provider or model is specified, nanocoder will show an error message indicating the issue. Provider names are matched case-insensitively against the `name` field in your config.

**Mode Flag:**

`--mode` sets the starting [development mode](../features/development-modes.md) for both interactive and non-interactive sessions. Accepts `normal`, `auto-accept`, `yolo`, `plan`, or `architect` (and the fused `--mode=<value>` form). Invalid or missing values exit with an error.

```bash
# Interactive, yolo from the start
nanocoder --mode yolo

# Non-interactive, plan only — produce a plan without executing changes
nanocoder --mode plan run "analyze the auth module"

# Non-interactive, normal — will exit on the first tool that requires approval
nanocoder --mode normal run "refactor db module"
```

If `--mode` is omitted, `run` mode starts in `auto-accept`. Interactive mode starts in the `defaultMode` set in `agents.config.json` (see [Default Development Mode](../configuration/index.md#default-development-mode)), or `normal` if none is set.

## Project Initialization Presets

Initialize a project from the terminal with automatic project analysis:

```bash
nanocoder init
```

Add `--preset` to seed stack-specific guidance, context ignore patterns, and a
`/check` command skill:

```bash
nanocoder init --preset react
nanocoder init --preset nextjs
nanocoder init --preset rust
```

Every preset creates an analyzed `AGENTS.md`, a `.nanocoderignore`, and
`.nanocoder/commands/check.md`. The selected preset supplies the project type
and fills in stack defaults while detected languages, package scripts, and
commands remain authoritative where applicable. Existing files are never
silently replaced: an already initialized project is refused unless `--force`
is passed, `--force` only regenerates `AGENTS.md`, and existing preset files are
preserved.

The interactive `/init` command accepts the same options, including
`/init --preset nextjs`, `/init --force`, and `/init --lean`.

## Interactive Mode

To start Nanocoder in interactive mode (the default), simply run:

```bash
nanocoder
```

This will open an interactive chat session where you can:

- Chat with the AI about your code
- Use slash commands (e.g., `/help`, `/model`, `/status`)
- Execute bash commands with `!`
- Tag files with `@`
- Review and approve tool executions
- Switch between different models and providers

**Starting with Specific Provider/Model:**

You can launch interactive mode with a specific provider and model using CLI flags:

```bash
# Start with specific provider
nanocoder --provider ollama

# Start with specific provider and model
nanocoder --provider openrouter --model google/gemini-3.1-flash
```

This bypasses the need to use the `/model` slash command on startup.

## Non-Interactive Mode

For automated tasks, scripting, or CI/CD pipelines, use the `run` command:

```bash
nanocoder run "your prompt here"
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Simple task
nanocoder run "analyze the code in src/app.ts"

# Code generation
nanocoder run "create a new React component for user login"

# Testing
nanocoder run "write unit tests for all functions in utils.js"

# Refactoring
nanocoder run "refactor the database connection to use a connection pool"

# With specific provider and model
nanocoder --provider openrouter --model google/gemini-3.1-flash run "analyze src/app.ts"

# With context limit override (useful when model context isn't auto-detected)
nanocoder --provider ollama --model llama3.1 --context-max 128k run "analyze src/app.ts"

# Flags after 'run' command
nanocoder run --provider openrouter --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514 "refactor database module"
```

## Code Review

Nanocoder provides AI-powered code review for branches and pull requests:

```bash
# Review a branch
nanocoder review main
nanocoder review feature/auth

# Review a PR (requires gh CLI)
nanocoder review 42
```

This runs a grounded review of the target against the default branch: an agent inspects the pinned revision with read-only tools, and only issues that cite changed code and pass an independent verifier are reported. You can also use `/review <target>` inside the interactive TUI, or `/review quick <target>` for the one-shot diff review. See [code review](../features/review.md).

**Note:** On a terminal, `nanocoder review` opens the interactive session. Piped, redirected, or CI runs print the report on stdout and progress on stderr (`nanocoder review main > review.md`). Add `--output-format json` for the structured result. Headless review uses the same directory trust check as `nanocoder run`: pass `--trust-directory` or set `NANOCODER_TRUST_DIRECTORY=1` in a directory you have not trusted yet. See [code review](../features/review.md).

**Non-interactive mode behavior:**

- Automatically executes the given prompt
- Defaults to auto-accept (tools execute without confirmation); override with `--mode` (e.g. `--mode yolo` or `--mode plan`)
- In CI, non-TTY environments, or with `--plain` / `--json`, renders through the lightweight plain shell - no welcome banner, no boxed user echo, no "ctrl+r to expand" hints. A single boot line shows the provider, model and mode, assistant text prints as plain markdown, and a single spinner status line shows progress below the transcript. In an interactive terminal without `--plain`, `run` uses the regular Ink UI with the welcome banner hidden.
- Tools render chronologically as they run (e.g. `⚒ Read 1 file`) and appear in stdout before the assistant's next response
- If a tool requires approval that auto-accept won't grant (e.g. bash in `--mode auto-accept`, or any approval-gated tool in `--mode normal`), nanocoder prints `Tool approval required for: ...` and exits with status code `1` (`2` under `--plain`, including JSON output)
- Exits with status code `1` when the run fails: a provider or connection error, a retry limit being hit (e.g. malformed tool calls the model cannot self-correct), or the run timing out
- Exits with status code `1` with a usage message if `run` is given no prompt (or an empty `--prompt-file`)
- Exits automatically when the task is complete
- Uses specified provider/model if `--provider` and `--model` flags are provided
- Respects `--context-max` flag or `NANOCODER_CONTEXT_LIMIT` env var for context limit override

**Skipping the directory trust prompt:**

The first time Nanocoder runs in a new directory, it shows a security disclaimer asking you to confirm you trust the code in that directory. In CI/CD or scripted contexts there's no one to confirm, so non-interactive runs would hang on the prompt — pass `--trust-directory` to bypass it for that run:

```bash
nanocoder --trust-directory run "your prompt here"
```

The override is ephemeral: it does **not** add the directory to `trustedDirectories` in your [preferences file](../configuration/preferences.md), so subsequent interactive sessions will still see the disclaimer. The flag only applies to `run` and `nanocoder daemon start`; using it in interactive mode prints a warning and is otherwise ignored.

To trust a directory permanently instead, set `NANOCODER_TRUST_DIRECTORY=1` for a `--plain` run (the default in CI and non-TTY environments) or for `nanocoder daemon start`. The first run with it set adds the directory to `trustedDirectories`, so later runs no longer need the variable.

**Error Handling:**

If you specify an invalid provider or model, nanocoder will show an error:
- Provider not found in `agents.config.json`: Shows available providers
- Model not available for provider: Shows available models for that provider

**Note:** When using non-interactive mode with VS Code integration, place any flags (like `--vscode` or `--vscode-port`) before the `run` command:

```bash
nanocoder --vscode run "your prompt"
```
