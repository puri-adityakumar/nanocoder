/**
 * Per-session timeline lockfile. Mirrors `daemon/lockfile.ts` but lives
 * next to the session directory (`.nanocoder/timeline/<sessionId>/.lock`)
 * so the existing `pruneStaleSessions` walk can probe a session's
 * liveness without a separate index.
 *
 * The lock's job is narrow: prevent `pruneStaleSessions` from removing a
 * session directory that an in-flight process is still writing into. The
 * lock is best-effort - if acquisition fails for any reason the caller
 * logs and continues; pruning is housekeeping and must never block a
 * chat.
 *
 * Atomicity: the full payload is written to a unique temp file in the same
 * directory first, then published with a hard `link(tmp, lockPath)`. `link`
 * is atomic and fails with `EEXIST` when the destination already exists,
 * so a concurrent reader can never observe a half-written (empty) lockfile
 * and two racers can never both believe they hold the lock.
