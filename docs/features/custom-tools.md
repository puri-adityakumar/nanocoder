# Custom Tools

> **A custom tool is one kind of skill member.** This page covers
> tool-specific details — input schemas, validators, approval policy,
> shell-script bodies. For the broader picture (scoping a tool to one

Custom tools let the model call your own scripts. Drop a markdown file into `.nanocoder/tools/`, declare the parameters it accepts, and write the shell command. The tool shows up alongside built-ins (`read_file`, `execute_bash`, etc.) — the model can call it, you confirm execution, the script runs, and stdout comes back as the result.

This sits between [custom commands](./custom-commands.md) (markdown prompts injected as context, no execution) and MCP servers (full tool execution but requires running a separate process). If you just want a lightweight wrapper around `kubectl`, `gh`, `jq`, or any other CLI, custom tools are the right level.

## Quick Start

Use the slash command to scaffold a new tool with AI assistance:

```
/tools create k8s-pods
```

This creates `.nanocoder/tools/k8s-pods.md` with a template and asks the model to help you fill in the parameters, body, and approval policy. Or write the file yourself:

`.nanocoder/tools/k8s-pods.md`:

```markdown
---
name: k8s_pods
description: List pods in a Kubernetes namespace. Returns kubectl output as text.
parameters:
  namespace:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: The Kubernetes namespace
    pattern: '^[a-z0-9-]+$'
    maxLength: 63
  selector:
    type: string
    description: Optional label selector (e.g. "app=api")
approval: never
read_only: true
---

kubectl get pods -n {{ namespace }} {{# selector }}-l {{ selector }}{{/ selector }}
```

Restart Nanocoder. The model can now call `k8s_pods({ namespace: "default" })`. Run `/tools` to see all loaded tools by source.

Don't wrap placeholders in your own quotes. Every substituted value is already single-quoted, so `-l "{{ selector }}"` would pass the quote characters through as part of the value (`-l "'app=api'"`).

## File Structure

Custom tools live in `.nanocoder/tools/` in your project root, or in the `tools/` folder of your personal config directory for tools that travel with your machine: `~/.config/nanocoder/tools/` on Linux, `~/Library/Preferences/nanocoder/tools/` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\nanocoder\tools\` on Windows (or `$NANOCODER_CONFIG_DIR/tools/` when that is set). Project tools override personal tools by name.

The tool's name comes from the required `name:` field in the frontmatter, not from the filename. Naming the file after the tool keeps things easy to find:

```
.nanocoder/tools/
  k8s-pods.md         (name: k8s_pods)
  jira-ticket.md      (name: jira_ticket)
```

One file, one tool. Phase 1 only supports `.md` files; `.ts` and `.js` files are reserved for a later phase.

## Frontmatter Reference

All fields:

```yaml
---
name: snake_case_name           # required, must match ^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$
description: Description shown to the LLM   # required
parameters:                     # optional, default {}
  param_name:                   # snake_case, must match ^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$
    type: string | number | integer | boolean | array
    description: shown to the LLM
    required: true | false      # default false
    default: any                # filled in when the model omits the argument
    enum: [a, b, c]             # restrict values
    pattern: '^regex$'          # string only, max 1024 characters
    minLength: 1                # string only
    maxLength: 100              # string only
    min: 0                      # number/integer only
    max: 1000                   # number/integer only
    items: {type: string}       # array only — type of each element
approval: never | always | destructive   # default: always
read_only: true | false         # default: (approval == never)
timeout_ms: 30000               # default 30000, max 300000
cwd: ./scripts                  # default: project root; supports ${VAR}; must stay in the project
env:
  FOO: bar                      # extra env vars; values support ${VAR}
shell: bash | sh                # default: bash if available, else sh; Windows: ComSpec/cmd.exe
---

# Body is a shell script. See "Template Syntax" below.
```

`parameters` also accepts a list of entries that each carry their own `name:`, the shape AI-generated stubs often produce:

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: namespace
    type: string
    required: true
```

### Approval

- `approval: never` — runs without confirmation (still subject to mode-based overrides).
- `approval: always` (default) — always prompts the user.
- `approval: destructive` - prompts in `normal` mode but auto-approves in `auto-accept`, `architect` and `yolo` modes, matching how built-in file-mutation tools behave.

Tools listed in the top-level `alwaysAllow` config field skip the prompt regardless. Tools listed in `disabledTools` don't load at all.

### read_only

Tools marked `read_only: true` can run in parallel with other read-only tools. The default is `true` when `approval: never`, otherwise `false`. Set it explicitly if your tool reads state but still needs approval, or vice versa.

### Working directory

`cwd` defaults to the project root. Relative paths resolve against it, and `${VAR}` is substituted from the environment first.

The resolved directory has to stay inside the project once symlinks are resolved. A `cwd` that escapes - an absolute path elsewhere, `${HOME}`, a `../` traversal, or a `./scripts` that is a symlink pointing out of the repo - fails the tool call with `Custom tool cwd escapes the project directory`. The tool is not run somewhere else instead: silently relocating a script that expects a scratch directory is how a `rm -rf ./*` body ends up pointed at your project.

A `cwd` that does not exist is not an error - it falls back to the project root, so a tool referencing a directory a teammate has not checked out yet still runs.

This is containment against misconfiguration, not a sandbox. The script body is arbitrary shell and can `cd` wherever it likes; the check only governs where the shell starts.

## Template Syntax

The body is a shell script with two placeholder forms:

- **`{{ name }}`** — substitutes `args[name]`, quoted for the selected shell. Arrays expand to space-separated quoted tokens.
- **`{{# name }}…{{/ name }}`** — section: included only when `args[name]` is truthy (non-empty string, non-empty array, non-zero number, `true`, etc.). Nested sections are supported.
- **`{{^ name }}…{{/ name }}`** — inverted section: included only when `args[name]` is falsy/empty (the complement of `{{# name }}`).

Substituted values are wrapped in POSIX single quotes under bash/sh. Under cmd.exe they are wrapped in double quotes and embedded quotes are doubled; delayed expansion is disabled. Because cmd.exe has no reliable command-line escape for percent expansion or embedded command separators, values containing percent signs, newlines, null bytes, or carriage returns are rejected instead of being executed.

On POSIX shells, this blocks shell injection through parameter values:

```markdown
echo {{ name }}
```

With `args = { name: "; rm -rf /; #" }` the rendered body becomes:

```sh
echo '; rm -rf /; #'
```

`echo` sees one argument, not three commands.

## Execution

When the tool runs:

1. Parameters are validated against the declared schema. Validation errors (missing required params, wrong types, pattern mismatch, etc.) come back as `⚒ Missing required parameter: foo`-style messages without invoking the script.
2. The body is rendered, then handed to the chosen shell (`-c` for bash/sh, `/d /v:off /s /c` with one outer command wrapper for cmd.exe). `shell: bash` / `shell: sh` still spawn `/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh` even on Windows, which typically fails with "Custom tool failed to start" if those binaries are missing.
3. `cwd` and `env` are resolved (with `${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default}` substitution against `process.env`). See [Working directory](#working-directory) for the containment rules.
4. The script runs with `timeout_ms` enforcement.
5. The output always starts with `EXIT_CODE: N`, followed by the captured output. When the script wrote to stderr, the output is split into `STDERR:` and `STDOUT:` sections. Everything is truncated at the standard output limit.
6. A non-zero exit is not treated as a tool failure: the model sees the exit code and output and decides what to do, the same as with `execute_bash`. Plenty of CLIs (`grep`, `git diff --exit-code`, test runners) exit non-zero in normal use. The tool call only fails outright when the shell can't start or the script hits `timeout_ms`.

## Mode Behavior

| Mode | Custom tool behavior |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| `normal` | All custom tools available; approval policy applies. |
| `auto-accept` | Same as normal, but `destructive` approval auto-approves. |
| `architect` | Same as auto-accept. |
| `yolo` | All tools auto-approve. |
| `plan` | Only `approval: never` + `read_only: true` tools are available. |
| `headless` (daemon-triggered runs) | Only `approval: never` tools are available; nothing that needs a human prompt. |

## Slash Commands

- `/tools` — list every registered tool grouped by source (built-in, MCP, custom). Useful for confirming your file got picked up.
- `/tools create <name>` — scaffold a new custom tool under `.nanocoder/tools/<name>.md` and start an AI-assisted session to fill it in. Dashes in the filename become underscores in the tool name (`k8s-pods` → `k8s_pods`).

## Security Model

A custom tool runs with your full shell privileges. The trust boundary is "you wrote this file or you trust the repo it came from" — the same model as `.nanocoder/commands/`, `.envrc`, or `package.json` scripts. Parameter values are quoted for the selected shell, subject to the cmd.exe restrictions above. The script body itself is whatever you wrote: if you put `rm -rf /` in there, it will run.

Project tools sit in `.nanocoder/tools/` and travel with the repo; personal tools sit in your personal config directory and don't. Treat custom tools from an unfamiliar repo with the same skepticism you'd apply to running its install script.

## What This Is Not

- **Not an MCP replacement.** MCP is for tools that need their own process, state, or are shared across multiple Nanocoder users. Custom tools are for project-local helpers.
- **Not a sandbox.** No isolation; full user privileges.
- **Not a distribution mechanism.** No registry, no `nanocoder install`. Copy files between repos manually.
